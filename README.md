# Cpp-Boids-Simulation 

Stable boids simulation in C++ written using standard libraries along with Eigen for linear algebra and SFML as the graphics library. Feel free to tweak some of the parameters in the code, the settings I've got it at are for a few large stable flocks to fly generally in parallel with only occasional large scale interactions.

All of the code you likely care about is in main, everything else was built with Visual Studio's default C++ solution setup.

Future updates:

Including libraries along with the VS solution for easier download and setup process.
Centralise all of the parameters to be easily changed within the code
Optimise variable types
Add video of program running
GPU utilisation for increased performance (CPU multiprocessing causes SFML graphics library to throw a fit).
