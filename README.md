# Cpp-Boids-Simulation 

Stable boids simulation in C++ written using standard libraries along with Eigen for linear algebra and SFML as the graphics library. Feel free to tweak some of the parameters in the code, the settings I've got it at are for a few large stable flocks to fly generally in parallel with only occasional large scale interactions.
